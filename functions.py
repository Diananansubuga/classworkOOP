# Write a function that takes the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right triangle as
# its parameters. Return the hypotenuse of the triangle, computed using Pythagorean
# theorem, as the functionâ€™s result. Include a main program that reads the lengths of
# the shorter sides of a right triangle from the user, uses your function to compute the
# length of the hypotenuse, and displays the result.
